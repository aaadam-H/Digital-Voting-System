# Digital-Voting-System
This repo is for safekeeping mini project of my Microprocessor System subject NMJ21704 taken on semester 2, 2024/2025 

This project demonstrates the application of microprocessor system in developing a voting system. Users interact with the system via a keypad to select their preferred candidate. Each vote is stored in memory and displayed on 7-segment displays. System feedback is provided using onboard LEDs. An interrupt-based Admin Mode allows secure access to display results.
